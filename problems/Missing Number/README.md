Problem: https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/missing-number-in-array/0

### Description:
Just exploit Gauss' formula to find the sum of the first n natural numbers and subtract to it the input sum

O(n) 
to read the input, O(1) to find the missing number
# Space cost:
O(1) since we sum on the fly the input
