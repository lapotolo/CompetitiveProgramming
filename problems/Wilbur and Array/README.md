# Wilbur and arrays
Problem: http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/603/A

### Description:
Read one number at time. For each number read increment the number of needed operation by the difference between the last value read
and the current value read.

# Time cost:
O(n) to scan the input array
# Space cost:
O(1) since we just store few variables. It's not needed to store the whole input array
